# Dataset-of-Remote-Sensing-image-Scene-Graph-Generation-based-on-segmentation-results
The dataset of remote sensing image scene graph generation based on segmentation results, which is used in the papers "SRSG and S2SG: A Model and a Dataset for Scene Graph Generation of Remote Sensing Images From Segmentation Results" and "RSSGG_CS: Remote Sensing Image Scene Graph Generation by Fusing Contextual Information and Statistical Knowledge".
The dataset [S2SG](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U5x30MpUerMuEPkcPnO7KtWP-GU_AMp1?usp=drive_link) is annotated based on the WHDLD dataset. 
The file contains the source code for the annotation tool used to label semantic relationships, which can be modified according to actual needs.
