# SRSG and S2SG: A Model and a Dataset for Scene Graph Generation of Remote Sensing Images From Segmentation Results
The dataset of remote sensing image scene graph generation based on segmentation results, which is used in the papers "SRSG and S2SG: A Model and a Dataset for Scene Graph Generation of Remote Sensing Images From Segmentation Results" and "RSSGG_CS: Remote Sensing Image Scene Graph Generation by Fusing Contextual Information and Statistical Knowledge".
The dataset [S2SG](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U5x30MpUerMuEPkcPnO7KtWP-GU_AMp1?usp=drive_link) is annotated based on the WHDLD dataset. 
The file contains the source code for the annotation tool used to label semantic relationships, which can be modified according to actual needs.
